# usefulPythonCode-S.Watanabe
Collection of Python scripts I personally use everyday.

Developed in Python 3.

#How to Use
Basic knowledge of Python is required, most crucially the ability to install required libraries and how to run the script.
Once the script starts running, for most a GUI (graphical interface) should pop-up asking to select files. On some scripts that is all, but others may require you to return to the command prompt/terminal to enter additional information.

#Python
Reccomended as the first programming language to learn by many, and the massive collection of 3rd party libraries makes Python a powerful timesaver as well.
