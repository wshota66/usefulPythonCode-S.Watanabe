# usefulPythonCode-S.Watanabe
Collection of Python scripts I personally use everyday.

## FileNameOperations
Manipulates file name(s) for multiple file(s) in Windows. Contains scripts for adding prefices ("[prefix]-filename.ext"), suffices ("filename-[suffix].ext") and replacing/deleting specific phrases in a file name. Basic operations but comes in very handy when organizing files by file name in single-directory databases.

## cv2ImageOperations
Makes extensive use of OpenCV to perform simple image transformations, such as resizing and binary filtering. Multiple images can be selected on the "open file" window to manipulate them in bulk.

Developed in Python 3.

# How to Use
A Python installation (preferably Python 3) and basic knowledge of Python is required, most crucially the ability to install required libraries and how to run the script. For most scripts in here, running should open up a GUI (graphical interface) asking to select files. On some scripts that is all, but others may require you to return to the command prompt/terminal to enter additional information.

# Python
Reccomended as the first programming language to learn by many, it uses easi(er) to understand syntax and boasts a massive collection of 3rd party libraries (libraries: basically code packaged into accessible functions) makes Python a powerful tool that continues to grow along with its large community of contributors.
