# usefulPythonCode-S.Watanabe
Collection of Python scripts I personally use everyday.

Developed in Python 3.

# How to Use
Basic knowledge of Python is required, most crucially the ability to install required libraries and how to run the script.
For most scripts in here, running should open up a GUI (graphical interface) asking to select files. On some scripts that is all, but others may require you to return to the command prompt/terminal to enter additional information.

# Python
Reccomended as the first programming language to learn by many, and the massive collection of 3rd party libraries makes Python a powerful timesaver as well.
